* Policy summary
 
      This policy will create consistent set of snapshots of tagged instances based on the following 1 schedule(s):
      weekly-tuesday-friday-snapshot:
      Every Tuesday and Friday starting at 02:00 UTC. A maximum of 4 snapshots will be retained of a target instance

### Explanations of schedules and snapshot creation times
* The snapshot creation doesn't start immediately when the **Starting at** time has been reached.
* Quotes from https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/snapshot-lifecycle.html#dlm-lifecycle-policies
  * *Schedulesâ€”The start times and intervals for creating snapshots. The first snapshot is created by a policy within one hour after the specified start time. Subsequent snapshots are created within one hour of their scheduled time. A policy can have up to four schedules; one mandatory schedule and up to three optional schedules. For more information, see Policy schedules.*
  * *For example, you could create a policy that manages all EBS volumes that have a tag with a key of account and a value of finance, creates snapshots every 24 hours at 0900 UTC, and retains the five most recent snapshots. Snapshot creation would start by 0959 each day.*
